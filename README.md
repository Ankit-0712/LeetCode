# Algorithmic Solutions Repository 🧠
This repository contains a collection of algorithmic solutions to various problems, including mathematical computations, data analysis, and string manipulation. The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive set of solutions to common algorithmic problems, making it easier for developers to find and implement the solutions they need. 🚀

## Features 🚀
* Solutions to various algorithmic problems, including:
	+ Mathematical computations (e.g., exponentiation, division)
	+ Data analysis (e.g., finding repeated elements, counting good numbers)
	+ String manipulation (e.g., sorting vowels, deleting columns)
* Implementations in Java, with some solutions using SQL
* Well-structured and readable code, with clear comments and documentation
* Easy to navigate and find specific solutions

## Tech Stack 🛠️
* Java (primary programming language)
* SQL (used for some database-related solutions)
* MySQL (database management system used for some solutions)
* Java Standard Library (used for various utility functions and data structures)

## Installation 📦
To use the solutions in this repository, simply clone the repository and import the projects into your preferred IDE. No additional installation is required, as the solutions are self-contained and do not rely on external dependencies.

## Usage 💻
To use a specific solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file for that solution. Most solutions can be run directly from the command line or through an IDE.
